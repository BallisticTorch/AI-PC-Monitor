# AI-PC-Monitor

A PC Monitor that will verbally communicate with a user, informing user of specific status of their PC.

The program will greet the user first. Then it will begin polling performance information of the PC and relay that information
verbally to the user.

Information Spoken to User:
- CPU Load as %
- Available Memory in MB
- System UpTime


This program is wholly incomplete and I have yet to return to it to get it to work. However, if anyone wishes to interact with machine 
level Windows-based system constructs, this is a decent place to start. I will update this with more information when I can.
